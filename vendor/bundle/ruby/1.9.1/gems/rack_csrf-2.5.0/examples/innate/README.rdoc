= How to use Rack::Csrf with Innate

These are two mini, slightly different, Innate applications. You only need
Innate to try them, so, assuming you have Bundler installed, run:

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec ruby start.rb
    $ bundle exec ruby start-with-raise.rb

Tested with Innate versions listed in the Gemfile.

Please, note that Innate is, to some extent, the kernel of Ramaze; "upgrading"
these examples to use Ramaze is left as an exercise to the reader :-)
