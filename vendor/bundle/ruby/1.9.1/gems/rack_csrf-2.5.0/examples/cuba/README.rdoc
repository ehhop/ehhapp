= How to use Rack::Csrf with Cuba

This is a mini Cuba application with two slightly different rackup files.
Beside Rack you only need Cuba to try them, so, assuming you have Bundler
installed, run:

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rackup -p 3000 config.ru
    $ bundle exec rackup -p 3000 config-with-raise.ru

Tested with Cuba versions listed in the Gemfile.
