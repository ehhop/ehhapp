= How to use Rack::Csrf with Sinatra

This is a mini Sinatra application with two slightly different rackup files.
Beside Rack you only need Sinatra to try them, so, assuming you have Bundler
installed, run:

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rackup -p 3000 config.ru
    $ bundle exec rackup -p 3000 config-with-raise.ru

Tested with Sinatra versions listed in the Gemfile.
