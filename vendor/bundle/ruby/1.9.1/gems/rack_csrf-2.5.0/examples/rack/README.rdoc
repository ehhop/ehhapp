= How to use Rack::Csrf with Rack

This is a mini Rack application with two slightly different rackup files. You
only need Rack to try them, so, assuming you have Bundler installed, run:

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rackup -p 3000 config.ru
    $ bundle exec rackup -p 3000 config-with-raise.ru

Tested with Rack versions listed in the Gemfile.
