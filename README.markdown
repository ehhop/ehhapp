This fork is home to a development branch of EHHapp called "ehhop-tech"
which is for the education and training of future Chairs of Information
Technology working at the East Harlem Health Outreach Partnership - a
free-clinic run by medical students.

EHHapp
======


**A mobile-optimized wiki built on [git-wiki][].**

The EHHapp is a user editable version of the original [EHHOP mobile website][] (sometimes
called the Referrals App), which contained pocket reference information that may be
useful to clinicians at the [EHHOP clinic][].

By making it user editable, the aim is to allow information to be more up to date and allow
EHHOP clinicians to self-manage the reference information that they need.

The editability functionality was forked from [git-wiki][], a wiki that relies on git to 
keep pages' history and [Sinatra][] to serve them.

Install
-------

The EHHapp is a Ruby/Rack web application.  Ruby is preinstalled on most Macs and packaged for
most Linuxes.  You should also install [Rubygems][gems].  The following gems are 
required:

- [Sinatra][]
- [mojombo-grit][]
- [Liquid][]
- [RDiscount][]

It is usually simplest to install the `bundler` gem and then within your checkout's directory,
run `bundle install` to install all required gems.

Then, note the sample configuration file: config.dist.yaml, copy it to a new file: config.yaml. This file can be customized as needed (e.g. toggle authorization on and off).

Finally, run the EHHapp with `mkdir ehhapp-data && (cd ehhapp-data && git init) && rackup -p4567`

Create a local config.yaml file. You can use this file to overload default options in config.dist.yaml.

Then, run the EHHapp with `mkdir ehhapp-data && (cd ehhapp-data && git init) && rackup -p4567`

and point your browser at <http://0.0.0.0:4567/>.

Data will be stored in a git repository in the ehhapp-data folder.

For deployment, the EHHapp is comparable to most Rack apps and could be served with, e.g., 
Nginx/Passenger or Nginx/Unicorn.
