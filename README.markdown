EHHapp: a mobile-optimized wiki built on git-wiki
=================================================

The EHHapp is a user editable version of the original [EHHOP mobile website][] (sometimes
called the Referrals App), which contained pocket reference information that may be
useful to clinicians at the [EHHOP clinic][].

By making it user editable, the aim is to allow information to be more up to date and allow
EHHOP clinicians to self-manage the reference information that they need.

The editability functionality was forked from [git-wiki][], a wiki that relies on git to 
keep pages' history and [Sinatra][] to serve them.

Install
-------

The EHHapp is a Ruby/Rack web application.  Ruby is preinstalled on most Macs and packaged for
most Linuxes.  You should also install [Rubygems][gems].  The fellowing gems are 
required to run git-wiki:

- [Sinatra][]
- [mojombo-grit][]
- [Liquid][]
- [RDiscount][]

It is usually simplest to install the `bundler` gem and then run `bundle install` to install 
all required gems.

Then, run the EHHapp with `mkdir ehhapp-data && (cd ehhapp-data && git init) && rackup -p4567`
and point your browser at <http://0.0.0.0:4567/>.

Data will be stored in a git repository in the ehhapp-data folder.

For deployment, the EHHapp is comparable to most Rack apps and could be served with, e.g., 
Nginx/Passenger or Nginx/Unicorn.
